In the 8-puzzle problem, a state is defined as an arrangement of the numbers 1 to 8 and a blank space (0) in a 3x3 grid. The transition model defines how to move the blank space (0) up, down, left, or right.\n","\n","- The path cost is a measure of the cost of reaching the current state from the initial state.

In the 8-puzzle problem, the actions are up, down, left, and right.\n","\n","- States are the different arrangements of the puzzle that can be reached through the actions.\n","\n","- The best heuristic function for the 8-puzzle problem is the manhattan distance. This function calculates the total number of moves it would take to get each tile to its final position. The manhattan distance is admissible, meaning it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, and it is consistent, meaning that the cost of moving from one state to another always satisfies the triangle inequality. This makes the manhattan distance an ideal heuristic function for the 8-puzzle problem and A* search algorithm."],"metadata":{"id":"k-fYJ8xpHic5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Imports"],"metadata":{"id":"5SPGHRvcD83j"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"dKA_R2uaDo89","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676156893809,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":1476,"user":{"displayName":"Nili BA","userId":"13639942577093263140"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import tracemalloc\n","import time\n","import sys\n","from collections import deque\n","import heapq\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Find Zero\n","\n","This function finds the location of 0 by iterating through the puzzel"],"metadata":{"id":"yOIQjVW6EEMU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def find_zero(state):\n","\n","    for i in range(9):\n","\n","        if state[i] == 0:\n","\n","            return (i//3, i%3)\n","            \n","    return None"],"metadata":{"id":"yAcsL2omEEXJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676148279196,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Nili BA","userId":"13639942577093263140"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Valid Moves\n","\n","This function is implementing the logic for finding valid moves in a sliding puzzle game.
